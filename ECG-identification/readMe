1. Files in ECG-identification/ECG200/ are from experiments using 10-fold cross-validation. The file "ECG200vgg_output_2.log" is the output log while training, validation, and testing VGG16 on ECG200.

"ECG200_comb_100test_vgg.npy" is feature vectors of ECG200 test data. They are extracted using VGG16 as an extractor. You can check their dimension to see from where they are extracted out.

"ECG200_comb_100test_pca20.npy" is feature vectors after doing PCA with n_components(20) on feature vectors in "ECG200_comb_100test_vgg.npy". This is to say, each row has length 20. 

2. Files in ECG-identification/figures/100_100_latest are from experiments on ECG200 with 100:100 original dataset split. The figure ECG200_txt_3.png is history of the experiment achieved the 0.97 test accuracy without cross-validation. Accordingly, in QCI/weights/ folder, "vgg16_200_txt_3.h5" is the saved model. In QCI/history/, "vgg16_ECG200_txt_3" is the history file.

3. files in ECG-identification/dense50 and /dense128 are from experiments adding only one dense layer after cutting the top of the original VGG16 architecture.

4. "comb" means combination of three transformation methods: RP, MTF, GASF while forming a "rgb" image. 

5. timeseries_VGG_16.py is the one you may want to use to train VGG16.
Work flow of it with cross-validation:
    1. doing 10-fold cross-validation on TRAIN set. Augment 9/10 of TRAIN set.
    2. then using the statistics of augmented part to normalize all of data(i.e. train, val, test set).  
    3. train the model on the train set. then save the model with the highest val_acc.
    4. evaluate current model on normalized TEST set(100 samples).
    5. go to 1 
    This loop will be done for 10 times as it is 10-fold cross-validation.
